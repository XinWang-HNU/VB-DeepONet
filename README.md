VB-DeepONet: A Bayesian operator learning framework for uncertainty quantification

The GitHub repository contains sample codes for the case studies carried out in the research paper titled 'VB-DeepONet: A Bayesian operator learning framework for uncertainty quantification'. Please go through the research paper to understand the implemented algorithm. Note: Results may vary slightly for different iterations of programs as random initializations of neural network is involved.
